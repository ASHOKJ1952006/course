# ðŸ“¦ Install Missing Dependencies

## Quick Fix for Compilation Errors

Run these commands in your frontend directory to install the missing dependencies:

npm install framer-motion
npm install axios
npm install react-hook-form
npm install react-hot-toast
npm install recharts
npm install react-intersection-observer
